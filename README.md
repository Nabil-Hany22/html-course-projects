# 📘 HTML Challenges (Course Projects)

This is my **practice folder** required to complete the course:

🎓 **[HTML Fundamentals](https://almdrasa.com/tracks/frontend-mern/courses/html-fundamentals/)** offered by [Almdrasa](https://almdrasa.com)

By completing these challenges, I practiced the **core HTML concepts** while building real mini-projects.  
This course is a solid foundation for anyone starting in **Frontend Development**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The folder contains **3 challenge projects**:  

* **CHALLENGE #1** → Multi-page static website (English + Arabic version)  
* **CHALLENGE #2** → Single-page project showcasing **CSS Fundamentals** concepts  
* **CHALLENGE #3** → Multi-page **School Website** (Homepage, Class Schedule, Contact Form)  

Each project applies the concepts learned in the course and helps in understanding how to structure semantic HTML pages.
